    <h1>Understanding Puberty</h1>

    <div class="highlight">
      Puberty is the stage when a child transitions into adulthood, experiencing various physical (including reproductive organs), psychological, and social changes.
    </div>

    <p>In Indonesia, puberty in boys typically starts between the ages of 9–14 years (average 11.5 years), and in girls between 8–13 years (average 10 years).</p>
    <p>These changes shape the characteristics of adolescents during puberty as follows:</p>

    <div class="section grid">
      <div class="box">
        <h2>Girls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Voice becomes softer</li>
          <li>Breast development</li>
          <li>Start producing eggs</li>
          <li>Begin menstruation (period)</li>
          <li>Fat and tissue development</li>
          <li>Hair growth on genital and armpit areas</li>
          <li>Widening of hips</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h2>Boys</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Voice deepens or cracks</li>
          <li>Hair growth in genital area, armpits, and on the face (mustache/beard)</li>
          <li>Testicles enlarge and penis lengthens</li>
          <li>Start producing sperm</li>
          <li>Widening of shoulders</li>
          <li>Adam’s apple grows</li>
          <li>Muscle development</li>
          <li>Experience wet dreams</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Why Is Understanding Puberty Important?</h3>
      <p>Understanding the changes during puberty helps teens be more prepared physically and mentally. It also helps prevent misunderstandings, embarrassment, or misinformation about their own bodies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Menstruation</h2>
      <p>Menstruation is usually the last sign of puberty in girls, typically occurring 2–3 years after early signs such as breast development. It is the shedding of the uterine lining that has thickened in preparation for a fertilized egg, but which is not fertilized. The menstrual cycle typically occurs every 21–35 days and lasts for 2–7 days.</p>
      <h3>Menstrual Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each month, estrogen and progesterone hormones prepare the uterus by building up the lining for a possible egg to implant.</li>
        <li>These hormones also trigger the release of an egg from the ovary.</li>
        <li>If the egg is not fertilized, the thickened lining breaks down and exits the body as menstrual blood.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Wet Dreams</h2>
      <p>Wet dreams (nocturnal emissions) are events where sperm (spermatozoa) is released during sleep. They often occur during dreams that may be sexual, but not always. Wet dreams are a natural way for the male body to ejaculate (release sperm). However, not every boy will experience them, and not having wet dreams does not mean puberty is not happening.</p>

      <h3>How Wet Dreams Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The testicles produce sperm every day, which is then mixed with fluid from the prostate gland to form semen.</li>
        <li>When the semen builds up, the body may release it automatically during sleep as a wet dream.</li>
        <li>Wet dreams are more common during puberty and usually decrease as boys get older.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Wet dreams are a normal and healthy part of puberty. It is not something to be ashamed of, and it does not require any specific action other than maintaining good hygiene afterward. If a teen has questions or feels confused, it’s okay to talk to a trusted adult.</p>

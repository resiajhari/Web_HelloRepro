      <h2>Understanding About Children</h2>
      <p>
        The definition of a child is someone who is not yet 18 years old, including children who are still in the womb.
        Based on this, adolescents are still included in the category of children.
        Children's rights are part of human rights that must be guaranteed, protected, and fulfilled by parents, families, communities, governments, and the state.
        The government of Indonesia and 178 other countries have signed the convention of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994,
        which includes 12 reproductive rights.

      <h3>Besides Rights, There Are Obligations</h3>
      <p>
        In the fulfillment of rights, of course, it is always accompanied by responsibilities that every person must uphold.
        Responsibility is one’s awareness of the obligation to bear all the consequences of their actions.
        This responsibility can apply to various life situations and may vary depending on the context.
        For example, responsibilities at home can differ from those at school. As adolescents,
        we have the responsibility to maintain and care for our reproductive organs so that they are always healthy.
